0.3.0 (2017-10-09)
==================
- Feature: Don't try to display a data preview if the number of records is too large. ISP
discovered that 3,000+ records can consume more than 1.5Gb of RAM in a single browser tab! Instead,
display a message asking the user to download the data. (Thanks, @AddisonSchiller!)

- Feature: Add "study completed" timestamps (the date and time the session was last modified) to
output data. (Thanks, @AddisonSchiller!)

- Docs: Split experiment docs into separate creation and data exploration docs. Add example and
explanation of nesting randomizers. (Thanks, @kimberscott!)
