### JamDB as a Backend

Experimenter's backend is driven by [JamDB](https://jamdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), which provides a performant 
API over a document store. It offers [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) validation of submitted documents and a 
versioned history of all documents. This goal of this section of the documentation is to give a brief overview of the 
JamDB API in its relation to Experimenter.

For now, the best resource on learning more about this is reading the code [here](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/experimenter/tree/develop/examples) 
as well as the [JamDB documentation](https://jamdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
