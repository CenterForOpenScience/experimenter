# Development: Randomization

Experimenter supports a special kind of frame called 'choice' that defers determining what sequence of frames a
participant will see until the page loads. This allows for dynamic ordering of frame sequence in particular to
support randomization of experimental conditions. The goal of this page is to walk through an example of
implementing a custom 'randomizer'.

### Overview of 'choice' structure

Generally the structure for a 'choice' type frame takes the form:

```json
{
    "kind": "choice",
    "sampler": "random",
    "options": [
		"video1",
		"video2"
	]
}
```

Where:
- **sampler** indicates which 'randomizer' to use. This must correspond with the values defined in 
`lib/exp-player/addon/randomizers/index.js`
- **options**: an array of options to sample from. These should correspond with values from the `frames` object defined
 in the experiment structure (for more on this, see [the experiments docs](experiments.html))

### Making your own

There is some template code included to help you get started. From within the `experimenter/lib/exp-player` directory,
run:

```bash
ember generate randomizer <name>
```

which will create a new file: `addon/randomizers/<name>.js`. Let's walk through an example called 'next. The 'next' 
randomizer simply picks the next frame in a series. (based on previous times that someone participated in an experiment)

```bash
$ ember generate randomizer next
...
installing randomizer
  create addon/randomizers/next.js
```

Which looks like:
```javascript
/*
 NOTE: you will need to manually add an entry for this file in addon/randomizers/index.js, e.g.:
import
import Next from './next';
...
{
    ...
    next: Next
}
 */
var randomizer = function(/*frame, pastSessions, resolveFrame*/) {
    // return [resolvedFrames, conditions]
};
export default randomizer;
```

The most important thing to note is that this module exports a single function. This function takes three arguments:
	- `frame`: the JSON entry for the 'choice' frame in context
	- `pastSessions`: an array of this participants past sessions of taking this experiment. See 
	  [the experiments docs](experiments.html) for more explanation of this data structure
	- `resolveFrame`: a copy of the ExperimentParser's _resolveFrame method with the `this` context of the related 
	  ExperimentParser bound into the function.

Additionally, this function should return a two-item array containing:
	- a list of resolved frames
	- the conditions used to determine that resolved list
	
Let's walk through the implementation:

```javascript
var randomizer = function(frame, pastSessions, resolveFrame) {
    pastSessions = pastSessions.filter(function(session) {
        return session.get('conditions');
    });
    pastSessions.sort(function(a, b) {
        return a.get('createdOn') > b.get('createdOn') ? -1: 1;
    });
	// ...etc
};
```

First we make sure to filter the `pastSessions` to only the one with reported conditions, and make sure the sessions 
are sorted from most recent to least recent.

```
	...
    var option = null;
    if(pastSessions.length) {
        var lastChoice = (pastSessions[0].get(`conditions.${frame.id}`) || frame.options[0]);
        var offset = frame.options.indexOf(lastChoice) + 1;
        option = frame.options.concat(frame.options).slice(offset)[0];
    }
    else {
        option = frame.options[0];
    }
```

Next we look at the conditions for this frame from the last session (`pastSessions[0].get(`conditions.${frame.id}`)`).
 If that value is unspecified, we fall back to the first option in `frame.options`. We calculate the index of that 
 item in the available `frame.options`, and increment that index by one. 

This example allows the conditions to "wrap around", such that the "next" option after the last one in the series 
circles back to the first. To handle this we append the `options` array to itself, and slice into the resulting array to 
grab the "next" item.

If there are not past sessions, then we just grab the first item from `options`.

```	
    var [frames,] = resolveFrame(option);
    return [frames, option];
};

export default randomizer;
```

Finally, we need to resolved the selected sequence using the `resolveFrame` argument. This function always returns a
 two-item array containing:
- an array of resolved frames
- the conditions used to generate that array

In this case we can ignore the second part of the return value, and only care about the returned `frames` array.

The `export default randomizer` tells the module importer that this file exports a single item (`export default`), 
which in this case is the randomizer function (**note**: the name of this function is not important). 

Finally, lets make sure to add an entry to the index.js file in the same directory:
```javascript
import next from './next';

export default {
	...,
    next: next
};
```

This allows consuming code to easily import all of the randomizers at once and to index into the `randomizers` object 
dynamically, e.g. (from the `ExperimentParser`):

```javascript
import randomizers from 'exp-player/randomizers/index';
// ...
return randomizers[randomizer](
	frame,
	this.pastSessions,
	this._resolveFrame.bind(this)
);
```
